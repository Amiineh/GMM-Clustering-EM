# GMM-Clustering-EM

In this project I used [Expectation-Maximization algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectationâ€“maximization_algorithm) to cluster a d-dimensional data into k clusters using [Gaussian Mixture Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model#Gaussian_mixture_model).

The input is a .txt file containing n lines, each line representing d space seperated values where d is the number of our dimension.
As you might know, the draw back of this algorithm is that we must initially define the number of desired clusters.

Here are some samples of this clustering. (the same samples are included in the "test cases" folder)
